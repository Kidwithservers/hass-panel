# hass-panel

This is an application creates an iPdad-sized panel that allows the user to interact with the underlying homeassistant server. At the time this was written, homeassistant had not yet rolled out the lovelance UI, and the options for a tablet display were limited. The panel uses jQuery UI to control element rendering, and jQuery to send requests to the backing homeassistant server.
